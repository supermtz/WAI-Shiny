Work Ability Shiny Application

This is a very basic shiny application to calculate the Work Ability Index (WAI) after filling out multiple survey like items. 

Upon filling out the Questions, the WAI is immediately calculated and its dimensions are displayed.

To be added:
- nice front end
- local/cloud data storage
- graphical output

Contributions welcome!
